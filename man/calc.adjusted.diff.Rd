\title{Compute Adjusted Squared Differences for MF-CSEM}
\usage{
calc.adjusted.diff(half1, half2)
}
\arguments{
\item{half1}{A numeric matrix or data frame containing item scores for the first test half.}

\item{half2}{A numeric matrix or data frame containing item scores for the second test half.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the squared adjusted differences for each examinee.
}
\description{
This function calculates the adjusted squared differences between two test halves.
It is used as a key step in the Mollenkopf-Feldt Conditional Standard Error of
Measurement (MF-CSEM) method.
}
\details{
The function computes adjusted differences for each examinee:

\deqn{D_i = (X_{half1} - X_{half2}) - (\bar{X}_{half1} - \bar{X}_{half2})}

where:
- \eqn{X_{half1}}, \eqn{X_{half2}} are the total scores for each half.
- \eqn{\bar{X}_{half1}}, \eqn{\bar{X}_{half2}} are the mean scores of each half.

The final squared differences are obtained as:
\deqn{D_i^2}
}
\examples{
# Simulated test halves
half1 <- matrix(sample(1:5, 30, replace = TRUE), nrow = 10)
half2 <- matrix(sample(1:5, 30, replace = TRUE), nrow = 10)

# Compute adjusted squared differences
calc.adjusted.diff(half1, half2)
