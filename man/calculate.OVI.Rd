\title{Calculate Overlapping Index (OVI) with Bootstrap Confidence Interval}
\usage{
calculate.OVI(x, y, B = 500, conf = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing the first distribution (e.g., total scores from half1).}

\item{y}{A numeric vector representing the second distribution (e.g., total scores from half2).}

\item{B}{An integer specifying the number of bootstrap resamples for the confidence interval. Default is 500.}

\item{conf}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence level for the confidence interval. Default is 0.95.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{OVI}: The Overlapping Index (value between 0 and 1).
  \item \strong{CI.lower}: The lower bound of the bootstrap confidence interval.
  \item \strong{CI.upper}: The upper bound of the bootstrap confidence interval.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the Overlapping Index (OVI) between two numeric vectors.
The OVI measures the similarity between two distributions, with a value of 1 indicating
complete overlap and 0 indicating no overlap. A bootstrap procedure is used to calculate
confidence intervals for the OVI.
}
\details{
The Overlapping Index (OVI) is calculated using the `overlapping::overlap()` function.
A bootstrap procedure is applied to estimate confidence intervals. If the bootstrap samples
are constant or if the procedure fails, the confidence intervals will be reported as `NA`.

# Example with random normal distributions
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 2)
y <- rnorm(100, mean = 5.5, sd = 2)
calculate.OVI(x, y, B = 500, conf = 0.95)

# Example with overlapping distributions
x <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
y <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
calculate.OVI(x, y)
