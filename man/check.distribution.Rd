\title{Distribution Comparisons Between Test Halves}
\usage{
check.distribution(half1, half2, B = 1000, conf = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{half1}{A numeric matrix or data frame containing item scores for the first test half.}

\item{half2}{A numeric matrix or data frame containing item scores for the second test half.}

\item{B}{Integer. Number of bootstrap resamples for confidence interval estimation (default = 2000).}

\item{conf}{Numeric. Confidence level for the confidence interval (default = 0.95).}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{Test}: The name of the statistical test.
  \item \code{Statistic}: The test statistic (if applicable).
  \item \code{p.value}: The p-value associated with the test (for Anderson-Darling only).
  \item \code{CI.lower}: The lower bound of the confidence interval.
  \item \code{CI.upper}: The upper bound of the confidence interval.
  \item \code{ES}: The estimated effect size for each test.
}
}
\description{
This function evaluates distributional differences between two test halves using:

- **Anderson-Darling Test**: A non-parametric test for comparing distributions.
- **Overlapping Index (OVI)**: A measure of the overlap between two distributions.
- **Kendall's W**: A non-parametric measure of concordance between ranked data.
}
\details{
This function performs three different distributional tests:

- **Anderson-Darling Test**: A modification of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test that places
  more weight on the tails of the distributions. A low p-value indicates that the two
  distributions are significantly different.

- **Overlapping Index (OVI)**: Measures the proportion of overlap between the two distributions.
  Higher values indicate greater similarity between the distributions.

- **Kendall's W**: Measures agreement between two ranked distributions. Values range
  from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement).

Confidence intervals for OVI and Kendall's W are estimated using **bootstrap resampling**.

# Simulated test halves
set.seed(123)

# Compare distributional differences
check.distribution(half1, half2, B = 2000, conf = 0.95)
