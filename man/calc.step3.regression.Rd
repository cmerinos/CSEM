\title{Polynomial Regression Model for Conditional Standard Error of Measurement (CSEM)}
\usage{
calc.step3.regression(squared.diff, half1, half2)
}
\arguments{
\item{squared.diff}{A numeric vector containing the squared adjusted differences between test halves.}

\item{half1}{A matrix or data frame containing the responses for the first half of the test.}

\item{half2}{A matrix or data frame containing the responses for the second half of the test.}
}
\value{
A fitted polynomial regression model of class `"lm"`, which can be used to predict
squared adjusted differences for any test score.
}
\description{
This function fits a **third-degree polynomial regression model** to predict the squared adjusted
differences as a function of the total test score. This step is essential in the calculation of the
**Mollenkopf-Feldt Conditional Standard Error of Measurement (MF-CSEM)**, as it allows estimating
CSEM values for any possible score level.
}
\details{
This function is part of the MF-CSEM procedure, specifically implementing **Step 3**, where
a polynomial regression model is fitted to predict the squared adjusted differences using
the total observed test score.

The model equation is as follows:

\deqn{ Y = \beta_1 X + \beta_2 X^2 + \beta_3 X^3 }

where:
- \( Y \) represents the squared adjusted differences.
- \( X \) is the total test score (sum of both halves).
- \( \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3 \) are the regression coefficients.

The polynomial regression is **forced through the origin (-1 constraint)** to prevent
unnecessary bias in the prediction of squared differences.

# Simulated example
set.seed(123)
half1 <- matrix(sample(0:5, 100, replace = TRUE), ncol = 5)
half2 <- matrix(sample(0:5, 100, replace = TRUE), ncol = 5)

# Compute squared adjusted differences
squared.diff <- calc.adjusted.diff(half1, half2)
